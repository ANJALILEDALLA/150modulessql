/*150)"In your organization, each employee has a fixed joining salary recorded at the time they start. 
Over time, employees may receive one or more promotions, each offering a certain percentage increase to their current salary. 
You're given two datasets: employees : contains each employeeâ€™s name and joining salary. promotions: lists all promotions that
 have occurred, including the promotion date and the percent increase granted during that promotion. 
 Your task is to write a SQL query to compute the current salary of every employee by applying each of their promotions 
 increase round to 2 decimal places. If an employee has no promotions,
 their current salary remains equal to the joining salary. Order the result by emp id.*/
